## Welcome to the Selcom Docs

The Selcom API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Currently the Selcom API has no test mode.

Selcom offers a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that gives you the ability to incorporate Selcom services into your projects. The API's are maintained and update with upmost care with security in mind and structured formats to meet Market needs.

To access Selcom API endpoints for services like Utility Payments, Wallet Cashin and Qwiksend. One has to get in touch with our Teams (info@selcom.net). Our Developer Zone has language bindings in PHP, Java and Shell. Code examples are on the right side of the Panel, switching to different Programming language make use of the Tabs.
